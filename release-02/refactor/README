1. Start the server by running `rackup`
1. Check port number from terminal output and open in web browser under `localhost`

```bash
bundle install # install gems
rackup # start server
```

### Database

If you don't have a database the current state of the `control.sh` can generate a database by running `bin/control.sh init`. It will generate a database with the `schema.sql` in the `db` folder. It will also place the database in this folder. This is important for the application.
